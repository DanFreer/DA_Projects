Data Analysis Projects

In this Project i found a fictional dataset from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/students-performance-in-exams - Aman Chauhan on Kaggle

This type of information has always been intriguing to me. I always assumed correlations between each of the subjects were related, and parenatal education played into higher test scores. Although this data is fictional, i found that it is close to real life.
